**Caution: This is something I use for playing around with new tools. This might never be finished and don't expect updates.**

This demo project combines Gradle, Scala, QueryDSL and Restlet.

The most interesting part might be **entity/build.gradle** as this is the place where the QueryDSL-Q-objects are generated.

Use **gradle clean build**
